import DownlyConcept from '../../assets/downly_concept.jpg';
import DownlyActual from '../../assets/downly_actual.jpg';
import DownlyScreenshot from '../../assets/downly_screenshot.jpg';
import DownlyLoading from '../../assets/downly_loading.jpeg';
import DownlyReady from '../../assets/downly_ready.jpeg';

As I was doom scrolling through social media, I often use these video downloader tool to repost memes. So I thought, how hard can it be to make a fully functional video downloader tool that is SEO optimized?
So I started building one. The initial idea looks like this

<div className="blog-image">
  <img src={DownlyConcept.src} alt="Downly concept design" />
</div>

Then I explored more on the idea (in detail) and after dozens of "tasks" later, it become something like this.

<div className="blog-image">
  <img src={DownlyActual.src} alt="Downly actual implementation" />
</div>

Few hours later, Behold! My own [instagram video downloader](https://downly.app)

<div className="blog-image">
  <img src={DownlyScreenshot.src} alt="Downly screenshot" />
</div>

This project consists of 3 repos and each deploys to instances (frontend, backend with task workers, IaC), it is more complicated than the image above (not by a large margin but still alot).
For a weekend project, not bad. I focused a little bit on user experience, PWA functionalities and some other things that I have forgotten by the time I wrote this. 

Few important things that I focused on (since I am the one who wants to use it),
- Making it PWA (installable)
- Shareable To (Web Share Target API) which means you can share to it from other apps on your mobile 
- Drops task if it takes > 2 minutes so that the message will be re-queued and reprocessed.

<div className="blog-image">
  <img src={DownlyLoading.src} alt="Downly loading state" />
</div>

<div className="blog-image">
  <img src={DownlyReady.src} alt="Downly ready state" />
</div>

It might be overkill to use rabbitmq for this kind of app but I planned on using it for other apps too.

This project will be maintained as long as I'm able to because I've been doom scrolling alot through instagram and I need to repost meme videos on facebook.
